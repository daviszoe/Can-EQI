# Environmental Quality Index (Can-EQI) for Canada
## Background

The Environmental Quality Index (Can-EQI) is an index of multiple environmental exposures for the 30 largest cities in Canada. The Can-EQI was developed through a systematic search of multiple data repositories to identify potential exposure datasets and selected datasets were verified through expert consultation across nine environmental domains shown to influence human health and well-being. The final exposures included in the Can-EQI were outdoor fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), distance to water, length of highways, distance to nearest coal, gas, or oil power plant, UV radiation, and temperature differences during extreme temperature events (both hot and cold). Variables were summarized into dissemination areas (DAs). Each variable was then reclassified into decile values (1-10) in accordance with hypothesized relationships to health, where positive responses to health were assigned higher values. Decile values were then added together to create the Can-EQI score. We then used an additive method to combine the decile values into the Can-EQI.
